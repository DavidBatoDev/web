Once we're all set with the registration, you'll kick off your trek through the vibrant rainforest of Kilimanjaro! As you hike, you'll be surrounded by incredible vegetation and, if you're lucky, you might even spot black and white colobus monkeys, playful blue monkeys, and a variety of colourful birds. After about 3-4 hours of hiking, you'll reach Mandara Hut (2700m), where you can kick back, relax, and enjoy a delicious lunch. Once we've finished lunch our guide will take you on a short 15-minute hike up to Maundi Crater, where you'll be blown away by stunning views of Mount Kilimanjaro, northern Tanzania, and even Kenya! It's then time to head back to Marangu Gate, where our transport will be waiting to take us back to our hotel. As you make your way down, you can enjoy the sunset and reminisce about the unforgettable day you've had!",
